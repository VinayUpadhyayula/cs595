Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) technique used to determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. The goal of sentiment analysis is to identify and extract subjective information from the text and classify it as positive, negative, or neutral.

The following are the general steps one usually follows for sentimental analysis:

Text Preprocessing: The input text is preprocessed to remove irrelevant information, such as stop words, punctuation, and special characters. It may also involve stemming or lemmatization to reduce words to their base form.

Feature Extraction: Relevant features are extracted from the preprocessed text. These features could include words, n-grams (sequences of adjacent words), or other linguistic elements.

Model Training: Machine learning models, such as classification algorithms, are trained on labeled datasets. These datasets consist of text samples with corresponding sentiment labels (positive, negative, or neutral).

Sentiment Classification: Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the sentiment of new, unseen text. The model assigns a sentiment label (positive, negative, or neutral) based on the learned patterns from the training data.

Evaluation: The performance of the sentiment analysis model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This helps assess how well the model generalizes to new data

Out of the various applications like customer feedback analysis, market(stock) analysis I am going with social media monitoring.
